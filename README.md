Scrabble15
==========
Two scripts related to solving a scrabble puzzle I though of.

The script Scrabble15.py generates all scrabble boards with 6 fifteen letter words crossing all the triple letter scores. It then saves and displays them like this:

	(republic)anizing
	 inter(paroxysm)al
	 sub(ordinate)ness

	 re(volution)aries
	 (catheter)ization
	 glycer(aldehyde)s

	r e p u b l i c a n i z i n g
	e             a             l
	v             t             y
	o             h             c
	l             e             e
	u             t             r
	t             e             a
	i n t e r p a r o x y s m a l
	o             i             d
	n             z             e
	a             a             h
	r             t             y
	i             i             d
	e             o             e
	s u b o r d i n a t e n e s s

The script ScrabbleGifMaker.py generates a gif of the games being played, may be reusable for other scrabble related projects.

If I was going to keep playing with this code I'd probably try to update the GifMaker; read in
